# QWERTY Keyboard
Qwerty keyboard GUI, made with PyGame.

# Features
- Contains keys: A-Z, 0-9, special characters ([]\;',./), SPACEBAR, DELETE, ENTER
- Keyboard scales in proportion to screen size
- Clicking a key causes the letter to pop up in the text box above the keyboard
- Keys are different color when pressed down
- Clicking on an empty key (other than SPACEBAR) will do nothing

# Usage
- Run main function to launch QWERTY keyboard.
- Type desired text
- Click 'ENTER' to print text to console and clear the text buffer
- To exit, click the red 'x' at the upper left corner of the display. If that doesn't work, quit PyGame from Dock (on MacOS).
